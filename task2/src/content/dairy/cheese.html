        <h2>Production Process</h2>
        <p>The production of cheese involves several steps, including:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Milk Collection:</b> High-quality milk is collected from dairy animals.</li>
            <li><b>Heating and Culturing:</b> The milk is heated and inoculated with bacterial cultures to ferment and acidify.</li>
            <li><b>Curd Formation:</b> Enzymes such as rennet are added to coagulate the milk, forming curds and whey.</li>
            <li><b>Draining and Pressing:</b> The curds are cut, drained, and pressed to remove excess whey.</li>
            <li><b>Aging:</b> Some cheeses are aged for flavor development, while others are consumed fresh.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Nutritional Information</h2>
        <p>Cheese is a rich source of protein, calcium, phosphorus, and other nutrients. However, it is also high in saturated fat and sodium, so it should be consumed in moderation.</p>
