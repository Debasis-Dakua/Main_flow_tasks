        <h2>Introduction to Butter</h2>
        <p>Butter is a dairy product made from churning cream or milk. It has a rich flavor and is used in cooking, baking, and as a spread.</p>
        <h2>Types of Butter</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Unsalted Butter:</b> Pure butter with no added salt, suitable for baking and cooking.</li>
            <li><b>Salted Butter:</b> Butter with added salt for flavoring, commonly used as a spread.</li>
            <li><b>Clarified Butter (Ghee):</b> Butter that has been melted and separated from its milk solids, resulting in a longer shelf life and higher smoke point.</li>
            <li><b>European Butter:</b> Butter with a higher fat content (usually around 82%) compared to American butter (around 80%), resulting in a richer flavor and creamier texture.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Production Process</h2>
        <p>The production of butter involves several steps, including:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Cream Separation:</b> Cream is separated from milk, either naturally through gravity or using a centrifuge.</li>
            <li><b>Churning:</b> The cream is churned or agitated until the fat globules coalesce, separating from the buttermilk.</li>
            <li><b>Washing:</b> The butter is washed with cold water to remove any remaining buttermilk, which can cause spoilage.</li>
            <li><b>Salting (optional):</b> Salt may be added to the butter for flavoring and preservation.</li>
            <li><b>Packaging:</b> The butter is packaged into blocks, sticks, or tubs for distribution and sale.</li>
        </ol>
       
        <h2>Uses of Butter</h2>
        <p>Butter is used in various culinary applications, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>As a spread for bread, toast, or crackers.</li>
            <li>In cooking and baking to add flavor, moisture, and richness to dishes.</li>
            <li>For sautÃ©ing and frying due to its high smoke point.</li>
            <li>As an ingredient in sauces, pastries, and desserts.</li>
        </ul>
