        <h2>Nutritional Information</h2>
        <p>Tofu is a nutritious food rich in protein, iron, calcium, and other essential nutrients. It is low in saturated fat and cholesterol-free, making it a healthy alternative to animal-derived proteins.</p>
        <h2>How Tofu is Made</h2>
        <p>The production of tofu involves several steps, including:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Soybean Preparation:</b> Soybeans are soaked, ground, and boiled to extract soy milk.</li>
            <li><b>Coagulation:</b> A coagulant, such as calcium sulfate or magnesium chloride, is added to the soy milk to curdle it and form curds.</li>
            <li><b>Molding:</b> The curds are transferred to molds and pressed to remove excess liquid, forming blocks of tofu.</li>
            <li><b>Cutting and Packaging:</b> The tofu blocks are cut into desired shapes and packaged for distribution and sale.</li>
        </ol>
